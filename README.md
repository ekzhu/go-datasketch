# go-datasketch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ekzhu/go-datasketch.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ekzhu/go-datasketch)

go-datasketch gives you probabilistic data structures that can process vary large amount of data super fast, with little loss of accuracy.

See [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/ekzhu/go-datasketch) for usages.

See the [Python version](https://github.com/ekzhu/datasketch) for detailed 
description of the data sketches. 
Both versions use the same serialization format. 
So you can easily use the serialized data sketches made by the Python version,
and vice versa.
