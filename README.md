# go-datasketch

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ekzhu/go-datasketch.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ekzhu/go-datasketch)

go-datasketch gives you probabilistic data structures that can process vary large amount of data super fast, with little loss of accuracy.

Also see the [Python version](https://github.com/ekzhu/datasketch). Both uses 
the same serialization format. So you can easily use the serialized data 
sketches made by the Python version.
